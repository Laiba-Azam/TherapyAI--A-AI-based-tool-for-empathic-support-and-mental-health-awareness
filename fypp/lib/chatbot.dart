Looking at this from a holistic standpoint can help you understand why you get these mood swings and what to do to balance yourself emotionally during this time. As a woman, we experience peaks and dips during our hormonal cycles and right before menstruation, we tend to feel not ourselves and down. The bloating and extreme cravings do not help either.Making sure your schedule is light and you have things to assist you can be so helpful. Different essential oils like lavender may calm you down, or orange which can uplift your mood. Homeopathy can be effective and gentle during this time as well. Birth control is known to help reduce the extreme spikes in hormones and can reduce your emotional and physical pain. Perhaps even psychiatric medication like an SSRI can help . If you are interested in going down the medication route, be sure to ask the doctor about potential side effects and risks . Reducing your processed sugar intake may help a lot as well. Exercising, spending time outside, practicing stress management and avoiding caffeine and alcohol can all be useful as well."

I've been studying hard, but I can't seem to shake this feeling of doubt and worry.\n\n**Compassionate Listener:** I understand how you're feeling. Exams can be a major source of stress. It's important to remember that it's normal to feel anxious before a big test. Here are a few things that might help:\n\n* **Break down your study material:** Instead of trying to cram everything in at once, break it down into smaller, manageable chunks. This will make the task seem less daunting.\n* **Prioritize your tasks:** Focus on studying the most important topics first. This will help you allocate your time wisely and reduce stress.\n* **Practice self-care:** Make sure you're getting enough sleep, eating healthy foods, and exercising regularly. These things will help you stay focused and reduce anxiety.\n\n**Student:** Thank you. I appreciate the advice. I also wanted to talk to you about my relationship with my roommate. We've been having some disagreements lately, and it's starting to affect my mood and my studies.\n\n**Compassionate Listener:** I'm sorry to hear that. It can be difficult to live with someone you're not getting along with. Here are a few things you might try:\n\n* **Communicate openly:** Talk to your roommate about the issues you're having. Be honest and respectful, and try to listen to their perspective as well.\n* **Set boundaries:** If there are certain things that bother you, let your roommate know. It's important to set boundaries to protect your own well-being.\n* **Consider mediation:** If you're unable to resolve the issues on your own, consider seeking help from a mediator. This could be a resident advisor, counselor, or another trusted individual.\n\n**Student:** Thank you so much. I feel better just talking to you. I'll try out your suggestions and see if they help.\n\n**Compassionate Listener:** You're welcome. I'm always here if you need someone to talk to. Remember, you're not alone in this. Many students face similar challenges. With a little effort and support, you can overcome these obstacles and succeed in your studies and personal life."

First off, it's totally normal to feel stressed before exams. Don't let it get to you. Here's a few things that might help:\n\n* Break down your study material into smaller chunks. Don't try to cram everything in at once.\n* Prioritize the most important topics. Focus on those first.\n* Practice self-care. Get enough sleep, eat healthy, and exercise. It'll help you stay focused and reduce stress.\n\n**Student:** Thanks, CL. I appreciate it. Also, my roommate and I are clashing majorly. Any advice?\n\n**Compassionate Listener:** Ah, roommate drama. Been there. Here's what I suggest:\n\n* Talk to your roommate openly about the issues you're having. Be honest and respectful, but also listen to their perspective.\n* Set boundaries. Let your roommate know what behaviors are not okay.\n* If you can't resolve it on your own, consider getting a mediator involved. A resident advisor or counselor could help.\n\n**Student:** Thanks, CL. I feel better just talking to you.\n\n**Compassionate Listener:** No problem. I'm always here to listen.
